### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Engineer for 20  years, passionated by image processing, 2D, 3D at first, then experienced in embedded development on a second time, I moved back recently on desktop multithread /multiprocess projects, mainly using  C++.

I can adapt quickly to new environments and platforms.
I worked on a lot of international, industrial projects with agile teams of various countries around the world. I can also work remotely, with high autonomy.
